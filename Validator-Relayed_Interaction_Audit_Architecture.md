**1. Network Interaction Auditing Mechanism via Validator Relay Nodes**
*   **Principle:** All critical network interactions (connections, task requests, task delivery, answer submissions) between Miners (M) and Contributors (C) **must pass through Validator (V) nodes**.
*   **Functions of V:**
    1.  **Relaying:** Forwarding messages between M and C.
    2.  **Anonymization:** Hiding the real IP addresses of M and C from each other. For M, all requests appear to come from V; for C, all responses appear to come from V.
    3.  **Auditing and Logging:** Recording with timestamps:
        *   The fact and time of sending/receiving requests and responses.
        *   Hashes of transmitted tasks (`H(T)`) and answers.
        *   Cryptographic signatures of participants (where applicable).
    4.  **Timeout Enforcement:** Monitoring response waiting times.

**2. Mechanisms for Detecting and Proving Violations**

1.  **Detecting Connection/Request Ignoring:**
    *   **V records:** Sending of a connection/task request from C to M; Receipt of a response (ACK/task) from M to C.
    *   **Proof of M's fault:** V received a request from C but did *not* receive a response from M within the timeout → M ignored the request.
    *   **Proof of C's fault:** V did *not* receive a request from C, but M provided proof of availability → C did not attempt to connect/request the task.

2.  **Detecting Delivery of Incorrect Task:**
    *   **V assigns:** A unique `H(T)` for task T assigned to C at M. Transmits `H(T)` to M.
    *   **M must:** Transmit to C a task matching `H(T)` (via V).
    *   **C can:** Verify the hash of the received task.
    *   **Proof of M's fault:** C provided V with the received task, whose hash *does not match* `H(T)`, and M cannot prove sending the correct task → M sent the wrong task.
    *   **Proof of C's fault:** V recorded M transmitting data with the correct `H(T)`, but C claims the task was incorrect → C is lying.

3.  **Detecting Incorrect Answers and Attributing Fault (Dual Submission):**
    *   **C must:**
        1.  Send answer `A_C` for task `T` to M (via V).
        2.  Send answer `A_C` *directly to V* (via client) with `H(T)` and their signature.
    *   **M must:** Send the answer `A_M`, received from C (with `H(T)`), to V.
    *   **V verifies:**
        *   Compares `A_C` (direct from C) and `A_M` (from M).
        *   Verifies C's signature on `A_C`.
        *   Verifies the correctness of `A_C` and `A_M`.
    *   **Fault Attribution:**

        | Situation (`A_C` from C -> V vs `A_M` from M -> V) | At Fault | Reason |
        | :------------------------------------------ | :------ | :------ |
        | `A_C` correct, `A_M` incorrect/missing      | M       | M distorted or failed to send C's answer |
        | `A_C` incorrect, `A_M` incorrect             | C       | C solved the task incorrectly, M relayed honestly |
        | `A_C` incorrect, `A_M` correct               | M (potentially C) | M substituted the answer (rare: collusion) |
        | `A_C` missing                               | C       | C failed to provide the answer to V |
        | `A_M` missing (while `A_C` is correct)       | M       | M failed to send the answer to V |

**3. System of Auditing Participants (Auditors)**

1.  **Types:**
    *   **Auditor Contributors (Auditor-C):** Affiliated with V. Simulate the work of regular C.
    *   **Auditor Miners (Auditor-M):** Affiliated with V. Simulate the work of regular M.
2.  **Properties:**
    *   **Anonymity:** Indistinguishable from regular participants to M and C.
    *   **Trusted Status:** Known and managed only by V (or their consensus).
3.  **Functions:**
    *   **Proactive Testing:**
        *   *Auditor-C:* Connect to *regular M*, request tasks → Record instances of ignoring, incorrect tasks → **Irrefutable proof of M's fault**.
        *   *Auditor-M:* Await connections from *regular C* assigned tasks → Record absence of connection/request attempts → **Irrefutable proof of C's fault**.
    *   **Verification of V Infrastructure:** Interact *with each other* via V's relay nodes → Allows V to verify the integrity of its own relay network.

**4. Arbitration and Sanction Procedure Based on Audit**

1.  **Evidence Collection:** V continuously analyze relay audit logs and reports from auditing participants.
2.  **Discrepancy Detection:** Automatic identification of:
    *   Patterns of request ignoring.
    *   Discrepancies in claims made by M and C.
    *   Discrepancies between `A_C` and `A_M`.
    *   Violations detected by Auditor-C/M.
3.  **Validator Consensus:** Based on collected evidence (logs, hashes, signatures, auditor reports), V reach a consensus decision on the occurrence of a violation and the guilty party.
4.  **Applying Sanctions:** The guilty participant (M or C) is subject to penalties (reduction in weight/rating, financial fines) or exclusion from the network.

**Final Effect of These Architectural Extensions:**

These mechanisms establish a **technically enforced and cryptographically provable system for attributing fault** in contentious "he-said-she-said" disputes. The use of validators as trusted relay auditors, mandatory dual answer submission, auditing participants, and cryptographic binding of tasks/answers enables reliable detection and proof of:
1.  Ignoring connection or task requests.
2.  Attempts to deliver incorrect tasks.
3.  Distortion or concealment of answers.
4.  Contributor inaction.

The system operates without compromising participant anonymity within the context of their operational interactions.
